movies = []

# using a loop and slicing (movies[start:end]), print the first five
# characters and last five characters of each movie title.

# you could also use a while loop if you like.

for thing in list:
    pass

# make a dictionary where the keys are fruits and the values are quantities.
# use at least three fruits.

# define a function that takes two arguments and uses them to update
# the quantity of a fruit.  Please rename the variables to something
# relevant to their meaning.

def count_update(arg1, arg2):
    pass

# Call the function to add 10 to the inventory of your favorite fruit,
# add 5 to the inventory of your second favorite fruit, and subtract
# 10 from the inventory of your least favorite fruit.
