# Traditional procedural programming thinks first about process steps

# OOP Object Oriented programming
# Organizes code around the things/nouns first.

# It uses the language of the users who's problems
# we are trying to solve.

# They are visualized with UML Class Diagrams or
# ERD Entity Relationship Diagrams, but
# simple circles or boxes to represent an entity
# and lines to show relationships
