    SDLC
        Waterfall
            One Marathon
                Analysis & Design == Requirements
                Implement == Develop/Code
                Test == Internal and External UAT User Acceptance Testing
        Agile
            Many Sprints every 2-6 weeks
                Same Steps as waterfall but repeated in smaller increments,
                    delivering value early and allowing users to steer and prioritize.
            Scrum == Huddle == DSU Daily Stand Up
                1 minute per person
                    not a simple status report
                    details to identify collaboration opportunities

    OOP Object Oriented Programming
        MVC Model View Controller

            Model
                Classes that represent the data pertinent to the problem you are solving.
            View
                How the data is presented to the user.
            Controller
                Sits between Model and View and coordinates their actions in response to events.
                Exceptions are made if and when it makes life simpler not harder sense.

            Server Side
                Model == Store and Retreive Data e.g. SQL Database
                View == Static HTML Templates
                Controller == URL Router
            Client Side
                Interacts with Server Side MVC
                Model == Data from REST API
                View == functions that render HTML
                Controller == User Event handlers,
                    and/or window url change event handlers
