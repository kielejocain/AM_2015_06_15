notes week 4

web api --rest api
api = application programmer's interface (app programmer = web dev)

system programming is the opposite of web dev. have to be smart about systems, not people
have to dumb it down so the dumb application programmers can understand it. 

we will be learning to produce apis so front end people can do stuff. 

http verbs
GET eg url
POST form submit, modification
PUT insert data
DELETE	remove data

rest api only uses get and post

xhr in developer -> inspect -> network is an xml/http request. 

static, restful, dynamic pages

haml, rhtml-- oter markup languages.

client/controller/model/view diagrams--look up
this is what a web architect does. 

ajax -- can continue to work with the page while other info is being collected.  

rest, ajax, spa -- all basically the same/ really close. 

rest url is called an end point 

e.g. /shoes/123

single page application

different from a regular dynamic page in that you are talking to the server to change the page. 
#all or #inbox or whatever is indicative of either scrolling to a section (thing.com/#header3) or of a rest page.
