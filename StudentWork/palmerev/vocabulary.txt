For each of the following words; please answer the following three questions using your own words.
    -   What is it?
    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)

1. Variable:
    A variable is a name given to a certain value.
    Variables allow you to give meaningful names to values, so you can ask for them by name,
      rather than having to remember them directly. You can also assign a variable to the result
      of an expression.

2. Operator:
    An operator takes a number of inputs (operands) and produces some output.
    Similar to functions in some ways, but different syntactically.

3. Assignment Operator:
   The assignment operator, written '=' in most languages, including Python,
     takes the value on the right and assigns it to the name (really an address in memory)
     on the left. Not to be confused with '==', which tests for equality.

4. String:
    A string is a sequence of characters. These are usually enclosed in quotes. In Python,
      either double or single quotes can be used. Character sets and encodings can vary.
      In Python, strings are a built-in type with many useful methods on them.

5. Float:
    A float (short for floating-point number) is a number with an integer part and a fractional
      part after the decimal point. These are only accurate to a certain number of places because
      of the way some decimal fractions are approximated in binary.

6. Boolean:
   A Boolean value is either True or False. The comparison operators '==', '<', '>', etc. return
      a boolean value. In Python, zero and empty sequences evaluate to False, while non-zero and
      non-empty sequences evaluate to True. Boolean expressions can be chained together with 'and'
      and 'or'.

7. List:
   A list is a mutable sequence of ordered values, represented by [] in Python. A list can hold
     any number of values of any type.

8. Dict:
    A dictionary, or dict, {} in Python, is a mutable container that maps keys to corresponding
    values. Dicts are iterable, but the order of elements is not guaranteed.

9. Conditional Expression/Operator:
   Including if, elif, else. Used to control the flow of execution. The if and elif accept a
     condition that evaluates to a Boolean value. The code in the if (or elif) block only runs if
     the given condition evaluates to True. An elif can only follow an if, and an else must follow
     an if, with any number of option elifs between them.

10. Function:
    A function is a piece of code that performs some action. A function may return some value or
    if no value is given, return None. Often functions take input and return output. They are often
    named and declared separately with 'def'. Variables created inside functions are local to the
    function are de-allocated when the function ends.

11. Argument:
    Arguments are values passed to functions.

12. Return Value:
    A return value is a value that a function (or operator in some cases) gives back to the part
    of the program that called it. This allows values to be passed between scopes.
