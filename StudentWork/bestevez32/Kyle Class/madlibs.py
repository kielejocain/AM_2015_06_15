#The WBC middleweight champion successfully defended his title with a 
#decisive fourth-round knockout of Daniel "Real Deal" Geale (31-4) 
#at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. 

#The weapon that did the damage was Cotto's left hook. The Puerto Rican 
#champion landed a titanic counter shot that sent Geale sprawling under 
#the bottom ropes.
