For each define the following:
	a. What is it?
	b. What real life thing is it similar to?
	c. When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
	

1. Variable:
	a. A variable is a place to store values.
	b. It is similar to a shopping cart.
	c. When assigning different data types to variables, integers, decimals and
		characters can be stored. 
			counter = 100 # an integer
			miles = 1000.0 # a float
			name = "Brandon" # a string 

2: Operator:
	a. An operator manipulates operands. There are many different types of
		operators including Arithmetic, Assignment, and Identity.
	b. The plus sign or multiplication symbol is an example of an operator.
	c. It allows operands in an expression to be evaluated. 4 + 1 = 5. 
		4,1,5 are the operands and the + is the operator.

3. Assignment Operator:
	a.These operators assign commands to the operands.
	b. Like in algebraic functions it performs order of operation tasks.
		(+= Add) Would add the right and left operands and assign the result
		to the left operand.
		(** =) This would be an exponent command that would assign the values
		to the left operand. 
	c.It allows for mathematical functionality in python.

4. String:
	a. A string is a python type enclosed in "" or ''.
	b. It is similar to an expression, example: "My Day!".
	c. It acts as a variable that can be manipulated in python
		code.

5. Float:
	a. A float is a type of variable that takes a decimal point.
	b. In real life it is similar to a percentage or a number that has 
		a value less than 1.
	c. It allows for for decimal values to be manipulated. 

6. Boolean:
	a. Boolean's are operations that produce true or false statements through
		"or", "and", "not". 
	b. This is similar to the idea of inputs and outputs in mathematics. 
	c. The operations are ordered by priority, much like order of operations
		in mathematics. 
		1st not: Give the opposite of the statement (not x = y)
		2nd and: Check to see if both statements are True (x and y)
		3rd or: Checks is at least one statement is True (x or y)

7. List:
	a. A datatype in python that is separated by commas.
		list1 = ['bacon', 'candy', 'car']
		list 2 = [1, 2, 3]
		list 3 = ["a", "b", "c"]
	b. A grocery list is an example of a real world example.
	c. A list is useful in python because it's values can be accessed when 
		the appropriate code is executed. 

8. Dict:
	a. A dictionary allows items and values to be assigned. 
		dict = {'Name' : 'Bacon', 'Type' : 'Candy', 'Awesome_rating' : 100}
	b. A phone book in a cell phone is an example of a dictionary.
	c. It allows values and items to be linked together in one data set.

9. Conditional Expression / Operator:
	a. A conditional expression is a statement that only executes under a 
		specific condition. 
	b. When a car's wheel is turned to the right the car moves right. This 
		is a conditional statement because a car will never move to the left
		when the wheel is turned to the right.
	c. It is used during if, elif and else statements in python.
		if condition_right
			car turns right
		elif condition_left
			car turns left
		else
			car goes straight

10. Function:
	a. A function is organized, reusable code used to perform an action. They allow
		for code to be reused. 
	b. Much like a function in math, the variables can be changed and manipulated
		while the skeleton on operations stays the same.
	c. The input parameters are placed within parenthesis in a function.
		This allows them to be manipulated within "for loops", without having
		to retype them over and over.

11. Argument:
	a. An argument provides a value to a function when it is called.
		x = foo(3) # 3 is the argument for foo
		y = bar( 4, "str") # 4 and "str" and two arguments for bar 
	b. In mathematics x and y values are arguments. 
	c. def foo (x,y):
		return x + y 
		z = foo( 3, 6)
		# This statement defines a function of foo.  x and y are the arguments.
			
12. Return Value:
	a. The return value executes the function based on the arguments.
	b. Return value is like the = sign in math. It executes the formula.
	c. def foo (x,y):
		return x+y 
		z= foo ( 3, 6)
		return = 9
