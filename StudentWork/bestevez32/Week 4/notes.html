    NOTES:

    API
        Application Programers Interface
        A set of objects and methods
        to make programming easier.

        A library of classes and modules for an operating system.

    Web API
        An API that uses URLS/Web-Addresses and Query-Strings,
        as methods and parameters.

    REST API
        An API that uses the Original HTTP Verbs and URLS
        as identifiers for both types and individual items.
        e.g. DELETE /shoes/123/

    RESTFUL API
        A partially restful API that uses a mix of
        HTTP VERBS, URL/URIs, and QUery-String Parameters

    Call-Back
        A parameter to an api function that should be
        called when a task is complete or an event happens.

        There are sometimes called Event Handlers.

        They allow for non-linear asynchrounouse programming,
        where you are responding to outside events,
        rather than running one step after another in a
        specific series series.

    Lambda
        An inline definition of a anonymous/nameless function.
        Used when passing a function as a value as in the case
        of a call-back parameter.

    Iterator
        A class the can generate a potentially infinite
        list of values.

    Generator
        A function that can generate a potentially infinite
        list of values.

    Generator Expression
        A Lambda expression that is a Generator.

    Functional Programing
        A style of programming that mor perfectly mirrors
        mathematical functions; where each function has a
        simple input and out put and only does one thing.
        Functions that do more than one thing are said to
        have side-effects, and side-effects are considered
        a harmful source of potential errors.

    Procedure
        In functional programming a procedure is a function that
        does not return a value.
