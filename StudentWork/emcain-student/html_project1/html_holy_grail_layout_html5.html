            The 1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand was the first ever tour of Australasia by any French sports team in history. 

            Puig Aubert captained the France national rugby league team who played 28 matches in total in both Australia and New Zealand, winning 21 of them[1] in what is regarded as the high point in the history of rugby league in France. The Australian Test series resulted in a 2-1 victory to France, however the tourists then lost their match against the New Zealand Kiwis. Welcoming the team home to Marseille, more than 150,000 people turned out for a street parade.[2]

Cathcart is a town in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa, named after Sir George Cathcart, governor of the Cape of Good Hope 1852-1853.

The town is situated on the N6, just north of Stutterheim en route to Queenstown
Church of Saint Alban at Cathcart in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa on the road to Aliwal North.

Originally a small military post, established during the Eighth Frontier War, it was established as a village in 1858 when German colonists arrived in the region. Work on its railway connection to East London on the coast was begun by the Cape government of John Molteno in 1876 and the line was officially opened on 3 November 1879.[3]

            Trialism in philosophy was introduced by John Cottingham as an alternative interpretation of the mind-body dualism of Rene Descartes. Trialism keeps the two substances of mind and body, but introduces a third attribute, sensation, belonging to the union of mind and body. This allows animals, which do not have thought, to be regarded as having sensation and not as being mere automata.
