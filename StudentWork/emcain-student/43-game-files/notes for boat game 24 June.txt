stuff to do today: 

-comment rest of game script, clean up where needed, make notes on what I'd like to do with the code

-test move conditions on a single connection. Hardcode the relevant move condition instead of using an in game mechanism

-move win condition from move to boat_action method in player

-get middle aged woman to ask you to help clean before she thanks you and gives you the toy. also the baker doesn't say her before text either

-after you interact with people it automatically passes you on to move. i want it to ask what you want to do again. also remove where you are print from the move method, it's redundant. 

-fix how "boat 0: the beach"--fixed 

next step: replace 42 test with test based on the move_condition object

-now i can't move to the new boat and it doesn't change from interacting with people. fix later.
