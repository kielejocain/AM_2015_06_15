notes for 7 aug on seabeck draft

did today:

added a crap ton of js drawing stuff

changed the detail system for determining the family to show--removed id from url, take it from logged in user

to do:

get rid of excess pages/templates/views
make the buttons on the detail page do stuff
hook up form fields to database
improve the general base template to have a sidebar with cost (UGGH THIS REQUIRES ALL KINDS OF STUFF)

Create templates or sample html for the other pages. Current structure idea:
-profile page for user/family with emergency contact and regular contact info
-detail page as exists currently
-housing questions
-scholarship question--real simple
-payment page

add logout button/link to everything

fix header to actually have the bread crumbs go somewhere
