Look farther down the beach. >>
You can't quite make out what it is down there.
Some wood platforms, like abandoned docks? Or perhaps a floating bridge?
It's hard to tell with all the sunlight sparkling on the water.
True
1. Move closer to the edge for a better look.
2. Go back down to the beach.
> 2
You find the narrow trail you used to climb the hill and proceed back down to the beach.
You head to the dock hoping to catch the next boat across the sea. You notice the Royal Guard's banner flying above the
dock.
1. Approach the dock anyway.
2. Head east along the beach.
3. Head west to the cliffs.
> 2
As you wander across the sand you notice what seems to be an abandoned fleet of fishing boats in the distance.

warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

In Git 2.0, Git will default to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
