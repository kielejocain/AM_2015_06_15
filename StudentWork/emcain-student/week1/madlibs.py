# A man walking in a national forest in central Florida has captured a rare image of a raccoon appearing to ride on the back of alligator.

# Richard Jones was walking with his family in the Ocala National Forest when they spotted the alligator.

# He believes his son startled the rodent while trying to take a picture of the amphibious creature.

# The image has become an internet sensation since the photo was taken on Sunday morning.

# Mr Jones told local television station WFTV that he "snapped a lucky picture right when the gator slipped into the water and before the raccoon jumped off and scurried away".

# "Without the context you'd think the raccoon was hitching a ride across the river," he told the television station.

# The photo was largely met with humour online.

# "The raccoon riding an alligator is the most Florida thing since mortgage fraud," tweeted Benjamin Freed, a writer for the Washingtonian, alluding to the financial crisis that began in 2007.
