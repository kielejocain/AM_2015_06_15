notes on Seabeck Draft--8/4

Did today:

added "attending this year" boolean field to api_campers
used JSON to create list of campers and format them based on whether they are attending this year. 

To do next:

figure out how to create and add buttons to each <li> in the campers list. 
create a function to draw a form below a given <li> for that camper. 
get the buttons to hook up to the function
get POST to work for the above
get the page to update itself when this stuff happens. 
eventually, convert the UL to Bootstrap rows, or a table.
