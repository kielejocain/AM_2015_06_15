notes on seabeck_draft as of 7/24

stuff I did today:

created edit and add-new pages for registrants and campers


stuff to work on: 

displaying the other campers' records in the edit/add new pages.

JS stuff:
creating dynamic forms e.g. asking for dob if camper is a child
form validation

General front end: CSS, Bootstrap (if appropriate), images. 

automatically adding the Registrant to Campers (may include asking camper-relevant questions when creating/editing registrants)

working out all the side stuff: food preferences (add these as attributes to Camper and remove FoodPref class??), shirts

Add classes for Housing Preference, Housing Assignment, Rates (or add to year perhaps)


Work out cost calculation, part time stuff
