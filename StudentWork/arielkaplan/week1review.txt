We will:

    Review Basics.

    Revisit core concepts.

Fog is normal.

Clarity comes in waves and levels.


Key concepts and their application is priority.

Memorization of syntax comes last and only with practice.





For each of the following words; please answer the following three questions using your own words.

    -   What is it?

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)


1. Variable: a name that is a placeholder for a value/function/etc
	= a box you can put anything in, including changing what's in it
	= whenever you want to not have to hard-code values
2. Operator: + - * / %
	= same as in arithmetic
	= when you manipulate values; doing math
3. Assignment Operator = setting a variable
	= labeling the box and putting something in it
	= whenever creating a variable or changing its value
4. String: "stuff in quotes." immutable
	= word/sentence
	= talking to the user
5. Float: a decimal number
	= a decimal number?
	= more precise than integers, makes sure division works as expected
6. Boolean: True or False
	= on/off switch
	= toggles for loops, checking if statements
7. List: [], a list of any datatypes, mutable
	= Quiz questions. Ordered list.
	= collecting and iterating over multiple values
8. Dict: {}, a collection of keys and values
	= a dictionary
	= don't care about order. want to tie information to a specific key rather than an index.
9. Conditional Expression/Operator: "X if test else Y"
	= test
	= run code if a condition is met, otherwise run different code
10. Function: some code bundled and given a name. can take arguments and 	return values
	= Input --> Black Box --> Output
	= reusing code! organizing code by what it's doing. 
11. Argument: value passed to a function
	= Fill-in-the-blank
	= Lets you reuse a function for many different inputs
12. Return Value: what the function gives back
	= Answer
	= Let you use a function to compute an answer and then automatically use that answer in some other code.
