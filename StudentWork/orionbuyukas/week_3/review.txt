1. Variable:
    -   What is it?
		A variable is a placeholder for a value.

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		A variable is similar to a label on a folder.

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
		It enables the assignment of data/value to an identity.

2. Operator:
    -   What is it?
		It performs operations on the opperands.

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		+, -, *, /, %, ==, >=, <=, !=.

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
		Basic math, comparisons, telling the compiler what to tell the computer to do.

3. Assignment Operator:
    -   What is it?
	 It assigns values from the right side of an operand to the left side. In some cases it performs a function then assigns the result to value on the left of the operand.


    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		The equals sign in algebra.


    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
		Assigning values, counters. It can be used to perform math operations on right side operands and assigns them to left side operads. +=, -=, *=...etc.


4. String:
    -   What is it?
		A continous set of characters. A python datatype.

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		A sentence.

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
		If you want to have a value for a variable that is not necessarly a number.

5. Float:
    -   What is it?
		A decimal number.

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
			Pi, or the speed of light, or Avogadro's number, cents, anytime you need to measure something that isn't whole number/integer. 

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
			If you want to know the product of an equation that is not an integer. ie. float 5 divided by 2 = 2.5

6. Boolean:
    -   What is it?
		A True False logical operation.

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		If you asked if I am at my computer right now, I could only answer True.

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
		When you want to test the condition of something. Such as stopping a loop when you have found the answer or prompting someone until the correct answer is given.


7. List:
    -   What is it?
		It is an addressable, numerically ordered, and mutable set of values. 

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		A numerically ordered folder set.

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
		Storing sequentially oredered data sets.
8. Dict:
    -   What is it?
			It's an unordered "list" delineated by keywords. More like a list of keys and values seperated by a colon inside curly braces.
	dictionary_name={key_1:valueofkey1, key_2:valuekey2} 

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		A dictionary where the words aren't ordered.

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
		When you want to sort and search values by keyword instead of memorizing the object's value or position.

9. Conditional Expression/Operator:
    -   What is it?
		Usually a boolean expression. Often an "if", "else" or "While" statement.

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		A thermostat. while heat: if the temperature in the house is less than 70 degrees: turn heater on, else: turn heater off.

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
	 It allows for controlled looping, and logical decision automation.

10. Function:
    -   What is it?
		A series of statemtents that can be called and accept zero or more arguments and return a value to the caller.
    -   What real life thing is it similar to?
		Putting ingredients into a blender and coming out with food.
    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
		Reducing redundancy in code/code reuse.

11. Argument:
    -   What is it?
	It is a value or values passed into a method or function. There are two kinds of arguments: "keyword arguments" are named arguments passed as a value in a dictionary; 
and "positional arguments" are not preceded by keywords. Arguments are passed into a function to take the place of their respective named variables within the function.

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)

12. Return Value:
    -   What is it?

    -   What real life thing is it similar to?

    -   When would you use it (what problem does it solve?)
