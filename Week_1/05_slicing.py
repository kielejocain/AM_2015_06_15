# Using the given string, here are a few string slicing exercises to attempt.
# string[start:end] or string[start:end:step]

s = "Hello world"

# Exercise 1: I want to live in a Jello world.  Do it with slicing.

<<<<<<< HEAD
t = "J" + s[1:]
=======
t = s[:]
>>>>>>> 86ba04e2d2b54fee2d7888a1fbd0d9febd033a32
print t

# Exercise 2: Use stepping to get the string 'lowrd'.

<<<<<<< HEAD
u = s[2::2]
=======
u = s[::]
>>>>>>> 86ba04e2d2b54fee2d7888a1fbd0d9febd033a32
print u

# Exercise 3: Use a negative step to print 'row'.  Hint: try s[::-1]

<<<<<<< HEAD
v = s[-3:-6:-1]
=======
v = s[::]
>>>>>>> 86ba04e2d2b54fee2d7888a1fbd0d9febd033a32
print v
