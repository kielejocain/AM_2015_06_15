# Using the given string, here are a few string slicing exercises to attempt.
# string[start:end] or string[start:end:step]

s = "Hello world"

# Exercise 1: I want to live in a Jello world.  Do it with slicing.

t = s[:]
print t

# Exercise 2: Use stepping to get the string 'lowrd'.

u = s[::]
print u

# Exercise 3: Use a negative step to print 'row'.  Hint: try s[::-1]

v = s[::]
print v
