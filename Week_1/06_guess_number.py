# this script should generate a random integer of the appropriate size,
# then allow the user to take guesses until they guess correctly.
# Additional challenges:
#   1. Report the final guess count
#   2. Impose a maximum guess count
#   3. Allow the user to change the maximum using from sys import argv;
#           you'd call the script with python 06_guess_number.py <max>

from random import randint

# store a random integer as `target` (google randint for help)

target = 45

while <condition>:
    # any indented code will run over and over again
    # until the condition is no longer true

# code no longer indented will run once the while loop
# is finished.  Is there anything you need to do to clean up?
# If so, put it here.
